General - YTD Accumulators
  
YTD accumulators, accumulate YTD values for Gross, Tax, Lump Sums, Allowances and Deductions.  The values accumulated are then used to print Payment Summaries, Pay Advices, and reports.  The YTD Accumulator codes are assigned to Pay Transaction Types.  A Pay Transaction Type can have only one YTD accumulator at any one time 

The YTD accumulations also determine the layout for the Payment Summaries for Taxation.

To access the YTD Accumulation, go to the following menu:
Departments/Payroll/Setup/Payroll Setup/ General/YTD Accumulations
