# PAYROLL PROCESSING
Depending on your requirements, you will use either Pay Timesheet Journals or Pay Journals to process your payroll.  You may also use a combination of the two Journals.

Pay Timesheet Journals are used to enter employee timesheets into the Payroll by employee.    Once completed you may then transfer the approved and locked timesheets into the Pay Journal.   

The Pay Journal may also be used to enter employee timesheets into the Payroll.
