### Award Interpreter Interpret button

The Interpret Button is used to interpret the Un-Interpreted Timesheet Lines displayed in the top section of the form. Once Interpreted the lines will also display in the bottom section.

**Interpret function:**

1.	All Interpreted Lines that have not been submitted are deleted for the selected employee within the date filter criteria.
 
2.	The lines to be Interpreted are summarise by day or week depending on the option selected in the Payroll Setup Timesheet Tab. 
 
3.	The times entered are verified that not more than 24 hours in 1 day have been entered. If more than 24 hours in 1 day have been entered the timesheet is not interpreted.
 
4.	The Interpreter reads the lines and processes the lines one at a time:
 
5.	The Classification is retrieved from the Payroll Employee. When no classification exists the times are not interpreted. 
 
6.	When a classification exists the program processes in sequence each pay item criteria that applies to the Award or the Classification. 
 
**Public Holiday Calendar: The time is checked against the public holiday calendars in the following sequence:**

1.	Employees Default Branch
2.	The Award
3.	The Employee's Payroll State
4.	Employee's Payroll Country
5.	Payroll Setup Public Holiday Calendar Code 
 
**Day Type:** The time entry is checked to see how much of the time falls between the start time and the end time of the criteria. The portion of time that lies within the start and end time is interpreted. If none does then the whole line is passed on to the next criteria in sequence. When the hours are interpreted the hours remaining that lie outside the start and end time is un-interpreted for the next item in sequence. 
 
**Min Hours:** Mon - Sun and Public Holidays are checked and when the hours are less than the Minimum Hours the hours are increased to the Minimum Hours. 
 
**Max Hours:** Mon - Sun and Public Holidays are checked and when the hours are more than the Maximum Hours the hours in excess of the maximum are passed to the next Item criteria sequence.
 
Apply to the following Day flag: The week ending date is based on the day after the time worked when the start/end time goes past midnight. It checks items whose start stop times go to the next day e.g. night shift. When a portion of the hours that fall in the same day that time period will be interpreted. The remaining time outside the time period will be passed onto the next criteria.
 
**Rounding:** Rounding of Up Down or nearest is performed to the Precision defined in the Rounding Precision field of the Item Criteria.
 
**Allowance Item Criteria:** After all the Pay Items are interpreted the Allowance items are processed.
 
 [GoToTop](#award-interpreter-employee-timesheets-worksheet)
 
**Application Type**
*	Always Applied: The hours are not checked and when the employee has worked the Pay Transaction Type defined in the filter the Allowance is Paid
*	After Hours: The number of hours worked for the Pay Transaction Type (excludes Min Hours Increase) is checked and if the hours meet the criteria the Allowance is Paid
*	After Time: When the time worked is after the After Time the Allowance is paid.
*	Before Time: When the time worked is before the Before Time the Allowance is paid.
*	Quantity
*	Fixed: When the criteria is met the allowance is applied once per week 
*	Per Hour: When the criteria is met the allowance is applied once per hour worked
*	Per Day: When the criteria are met the allowance is applied once per day worked.
 
**Exclude Leave:** The allowance is not applied for Public Holidays and Pay Transaction Types with the Apply to Leave Taken flag = true
 
**Applies to All Hours:** When ticked and the Quantity Type = Hours all the hours for the day are used to calculate the Allowance Quantity when the Allowance criteria are met.
 
**Maximum Allowance Quantity per tax Week:** When the weeks calculated quantity for the allowance is greater than the Maximum Quantity the Maximum Quantity is used instead.
 
**Applies to Pay Transaction Type Filter:** The allowance is only calculated on the Pay Transaction in this filter. When the filter is blank the allowance is calculated on un-interpreted times.
 
**Rounding:** Rounding of Up Down or Nearest is performed to the Precision defined in the Rounding Precision field of the Item Criteria.

### Award Interpreter Submit button
This option transfers interpreted lines to the Posted Interpreted Times table. The lines are transferred as adjustments if an existing posted interpreted time exists. The new / adjustments lines populate the Pay Time Sheet Journal as locked lines where they can be edited if required. 

You can also Transfer the Interpreted Lines directly into the Pay Journal.
