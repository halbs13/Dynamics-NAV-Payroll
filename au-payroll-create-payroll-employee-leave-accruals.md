# Payroll Employee card – Navigate ribbon - Leave Accruals

This option is used to maintain the leave accrual types for the employee.  The Leave accruals can be setup to default from the “Payroll” card and automatically assigned to new employees when they are created.  If Leave Accruals are not defaulted from the Payroll you can add the Leave Accruals to the employee manually.

To access the Employee Leave Accrual Card, click on the “Edit” icon on the Home ribbon.
