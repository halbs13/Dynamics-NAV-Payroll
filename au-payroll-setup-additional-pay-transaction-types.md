# Supplementary Information on Pay Transaction Types

This section will provide examples of how some of the new pay transactions can be setup within the Dynamics NAV Payroll module.  It will specifically discuss;

 * [Bonus/Commission Payment Transactions](#bonus-commission-payment-transactions) â€“ where Method A is used as the tax calculation method.
 * [Termination Transactions](#termination-transactions-using-the-wizard) used in the Termination Wizard
 * [Government Paid Parental Leave (GPPL)](#government-paid-parental-leave)
