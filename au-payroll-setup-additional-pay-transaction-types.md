# Supplementary Information on Pay Transaction Types

This section will provide examples of how some of the new pay transactions can be setup within the Dynamics NAV Payroll module.  It will specifically discuss;

 * Bonus/Commission Payment Transactions â€“ where Method A is used as the tax calculation method.
 * Termination Transactions used in the Termination Wizard
 * Government Paid Parental Leave (GPPL)

## Bonus/Commission Payment Transactions

Bonus/Commission payment transactions will need to be setup in a particular way to ensure that the correct method of tax (Method A) is calculated on the value of this pay transaction type.

The guidelines are as follows:	

1. On the **General** FastTab, ensure that you have the **Accumulation Type** set to *Lump Sum*,
2. On the **Calculations** FastTab, ensure that you have the **Lump Sum Tax Method** set to *Bonus/Commission* and the **Apply to Lump Sum Tax Method** is selected.


## Termination Transactions Using the Wizard

The treatment of tax is calculated within the Wizard based on the transactions that are setup within the Termination FastTab on the [Payroll Setup](au-payroll-setup-payroll-setup.md) card.

The guidelines are as follows:

### Long Service Leave taxed as Gross Salary & Wages (Marginal Tax)

1.  On the **General** FastTab, the **Accumulation Type** is set to *Long Service Leave* and the **P.S. YTD Accumulation Code** is *Gross*,
2.  On the **Calculations** FastTab, the **Lump Sum Tax Method** is set to *None (Termination)*,
3.  On the **Leave Application** FastTab, the **Apply to Leave Taken** is selected,
