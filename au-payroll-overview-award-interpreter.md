# Award Interpreter

The Award Interpreter Module is used to interpret employee timesheet hours into pay and allowance transactions. 

The Employee Timesheet entries can be manually entered or imported into the Employee Timesheet Worksheet, at the same time the timesheets are simultaneously loaded into the Interpretation Worksheet. After the timesheets are loaded or entered the user can interpret the lines and once satisfied you can submit the lines. After the lines are submitted you can transfer them into the Pay Journal for validation and payment.
