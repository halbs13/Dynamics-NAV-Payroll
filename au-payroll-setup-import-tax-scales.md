7.2	Import Tax Scales
When the ATO changes the PAYG tax rates a file containing the new tax scale coefficients is sent to customers who have a current Payroll Annual Software Subscription.  This file must be imported into the Payroll granule.  The user must have Supervisor security privilege (See “User” setup) to import the tax scales 

To open the Import Tax Scales window,

Departments/Payroll/Periodic Activities/Periodic Maintenance/Import Tax Scales

  Note the user must be setup as a Payroll Supervisor in the Payroll User Setup before they can import tax scales.

When you select the “Import Tax Scales” link, you will be taken to Windows directory. From here you will need to select the file that you will have saved previously.
