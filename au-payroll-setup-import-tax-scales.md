# Payroll Setup - Import Tax Scales

When the ATO changes the PAYG tax rates a file containing the new tax scale coefficients is sent to customers who have a current Payroll Annual Software Subscription.  This file must be imported into the Payroll granule.  

The user must have Supervisor security privilege as setup in the [Payroll User Setup](au-payroll-setup-payroll-user.md) to import the tax scales. 

1.  In the **Search** box, enter in **Import Tax Scales**, and then choose the related link.  Or go to the following menu:  *Departments/Payroll/Periodic Activities/Periodic Maintenance/Import Tax Scales*

2.  When you select the **Import Tax Scales** link, you will be taken to Windows directory. From here you will need to select the file that you will have saved previously into a directory you have access to.

3.  Once you have located the file, click **OK**.
