Work Cover
The rules and regulations for Work Cover vary from state to state.  

Generally the premiums are payable on gross salaries and wages.  If you pay salary and wages to any person you must have a work cover policy.  Work Cover is a state law and the cover provided under most policies does not usually extend outside the home state.

To setup Work Cover you must:
1.	Complete the Work Cover Rates.
2.	Flag Pay Transactions Types applicable to Work Cover on the Parameters tab
3.	Assign Employees to Work Cover Rates in the Payroll Employee card
4.	Optionally enter locations for reporting and Assign to Employees in the Payroll Employee card.
