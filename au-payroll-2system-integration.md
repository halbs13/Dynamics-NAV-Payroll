# SYSTEM INTEGRATION

The Payroll granule can be configured to integrate with the following Microsoft Dynamics NAV granules:

•	Sales and Receivables

•	Purchase and Payables

•	Resource Planning / Jobs

•	General Ledger

•	Human Resources

Sales and Receivables - deductions from the employee pays can be transferred to a Customer account to generate an invoice.  You can link the Customer to an employee deduction via the Employee Deduction card.  

Purchase and Payables – a payment is created by the system into a Vendor account for Superannuation and other types of payments.

Resource Planning /Jobs - Job Details entered in timesheet entry or as a permanent allowance for an employee are costed to jobs.

General Ledger - recording wages paid, superannuation provision, leave accruals, workers compensation levy provision etc.
