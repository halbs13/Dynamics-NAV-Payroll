# SINGLE TOUCH PAYROLL

Single Touch Payroll (STP) was introduced by the ATO in July 2018 and is designed to streamline your payroll reporting to the ATO. 

You are required to send payroll information to the ATO via a Sending Service Provider (SSP) as part of each payroll process. 

The ATO refers to these files as a **Pay Event**. This includes payments such as Salaries and Wages, Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG), Withholding Tax and Superannuation.  

Correction files are referred to by the ATO as an **Update Event**.
