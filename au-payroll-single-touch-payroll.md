# SINGLE TOUCH PAYROLL

Single Touch Payroll (STP) is the next step in streamlining your payroll reporting. It will change the way you report your employeesâ€™ payroll information to the ATO.

You will be required to send payroll information to the ATO via a Sending Service Provider (SSP) as part of each payroll process. The ATO calls this a Pay Event. This includes payments such as salaries and wages, pay as you go (PAYG) withholding and super information.

You will be able to make corrections if you make a mistake. The ATO calls this an Update Event.
