Payroll Employee card – Navigate ribbon - Superannuation
The “Employee Superannuation” window is used to maintain the Superannuation contributions for each employee. You select the Superannuation Product (s), date joined, percentages and amounts to calculate for both employer and employee superannuation.   

You can use either Standard Super (posts the costs at the End of Month) or the Oncost method to calculate the SGC % you cannot use both methods for the same employee.  

Use Oncost if you wish to Expense the cost when you post the Pay Journal.  If you use Oncost you cannot use a Base Salary to base the super % calculation.

Super contributions by both the Employee and the Employer are set up as a percentage or an amount each pay period.  The Employer can also contribute an additional factor of the Employee's Superannuation contribution. Click the Super button and select the card and complete the tabs.

The Navigate ribbon contains the following options:
•	Company - Displays the Superannuation card for the Employee Superannuation.
•	Comments - Used to enter comments for the employee superannuation company.
•	Ledger Entries - Displays a list of the Employee Superannuation Ledger Entries for this Superannuation Company.
To access the Employee Superannuation Card, select the “Edit” icon on the Home ribbon.
