# END OF YEAR MAINTENANCE

The following activities must be performed to maintain your Payroll Granule.
- [**Payroll Tax Year**](au-payroll-setup-payrolls.md) - create a new tax year.
- [**Import Tax Scales**](au-payroll-setup-import-tax-scales.md) - import the new Tax Scales file if the Tax Rates have changed.


## Create a New Payroll tax year

When creating a New Payroll Tax Year, it's important that you review all of the pay periods for the financial year prior to posting transactions against them.

1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Payrolls**, and then choose the related link.  Or go to the following menu: *General Setup/Payrolls/Home ribbon/Periods/Home ribbon/ Create Tax Year*

 
## Import Tax Scales

When the ATO changes the PAYG tax rates a file containing the new tax scale coefficients is sent to customers who have a current Payroll Annual Software Subscription.  This file must be imported into the Payroll granule.  The user must have Supervisor security privilege (See [Payroll User Setup](au-payroll-setup-payroll-user.md) to import the tax scales.) 

1.  The Import Tax Scales are imported via the Payroll Setup Card.  In the **Search** box, enter **Payroll Setup**, and then choose the related link.  Or go to the following menu:  *Actions Workspace/Setup/Payroll Setup/Actions/Setup/Import Tax Scales* 

2.  When you select the “Import Tax Scales” link, you will be taken to Windows directory. From here you will need to select the file that you will have saved previously.
