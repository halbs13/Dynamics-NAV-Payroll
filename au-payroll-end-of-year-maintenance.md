# END OF YEAR MAINTENANCE

The following activities must be performed to maintain your Payroll Granule.
- Payroll Tax Year - create a new tax year
- Import Tax Scales - import the new Tax Scales file if the Tax Rates have changed


### Create a New Payroll tax year

Create a new Payroll Tax Years for each of your Payrolls.
 
*Departments/Payroll/Setup/Payroll Setup/General/Payrolls/Home ribbon/Periods/Home ribbon/ Create Tax Year*
 
 
### Import Tax Scales

When the ATO changes the PAYG tax rates a file containing the new tax scale coefficients is sent to customers who have a current Payroll Annual Software Subscription.  This file must be imported into the Payroll granule.  The user must have Supervisor security privilege (See “User” setup) to import the tax scales 

To open the Import Tax Scales window,

*Departments/Payroll/Periodic Activities/Periodic Maintenance/Import Tax Scales* 

  Note the user must be setup as a Payroll Supervisor in the Payroll User Setup before they can import tax scales.

When you select the “Import Tax Scales” link, you will be taken to Windows directory. From here you will need to select the file that you will have saved previously.
