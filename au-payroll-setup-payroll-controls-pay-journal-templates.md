## Pay Journal Templates

This card displays the pay journal templates set up for payrolls.  Only one template can be used for each Payroll.  The template is specified on the Options tab of the Payroll card.  A pay journal template is automatically created by the Payroll-Initialise Code unit 16000400. 

Journal templates allow you to work in a journal window that is designed for a specific purpose and you can setup your own templates if required.  You can select a specific test report and posting report to be printed with the Post and Print and Test Report functions in a journal template.

By using the Source Code file, you can insert a code on the journal template that is copied onto all the journal lines created in the journal template.  The code is also copied to the entries when they are posted.  This is how the source of posted transactions is identified.

You can create multiple journal batches under each journal template.  That is, several journals, each with its own name, can display in the same window.  This can be used, if users need to have their own journal.


1. In the **Search** box, enter **Pay Journal Templates**, and then choose the related link or go to the following menu: *Departments/Payroll/Setup/Payroll Setup/Payroll Controls/Pay Journal Templates*.
