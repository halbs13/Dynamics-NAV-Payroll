# Cost Allocations

This option is used to setup and maintain percentages that split the employee’s costs over several cost centres.

 
E.g. an employee’s earnings may be split 50% to cost centre “A” , 25% to cost centre “B” and 25% to cost centre “C”.  Costs may be split over Branches, Divisions and Dimensions.
