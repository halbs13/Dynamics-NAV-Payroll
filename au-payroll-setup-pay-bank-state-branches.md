# To setup Pay Bank State Branches

Pay Bank State Branches are used by your employees to receive their payment by EFT.  You select the employee bank when you set up the net pay dissections in payroll employee setup.  Each Employee who has a payment type of EFT will use one or more of these banks.

A file containing the Australian banks is delivered with the system.  This file must be imported during setup of the Payroll Granule.

You can maintain the bank information and add additional bank details if required.

1. To access the Pay Bank State Branches, go to the following menu:  *General Setup/Pay Bank State Branches*.

2. On the **General** FastTab, fill the fields in the following table.

|Field|Description|
