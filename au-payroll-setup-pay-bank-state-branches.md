General – Pay Bank State Branches
Pay Bank State Branches are used by your employees to receive their payment by EFT.  You select the employee bank when you set up the net pay dissections in payroll employee setup.  Each Employee who has a payment type of EFT will use one or more of these banks.

A file containing the Australian banks is delivered with the system.  This file must be imported during setup of the Payroll Granule. 

For further information on importing this file refer to:  “Import Employee BSB Numbers”

You can maintain the bank information and add additional bank details if required.
