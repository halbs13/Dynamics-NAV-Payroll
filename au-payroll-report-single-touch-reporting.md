# Single Touch Payroll Reporting


## STP Submission Test Report

This report shows the information contained within the file created as part of the Pay Event. **You should never attempt to open the STP files created in Payfocus as this may corrupt the file, instead refer to this report for detail included in the file.** 

To access the STP Test Report, go to *Actions Workspace/Single Touch Processing/STP Submission Test Report*

Select the Pay Event Type (usually Update), Update Date and select OK.


## STP Payment Proof List

This report contains all the YTD values for your own internal reconciliation processes. 

To access the STP Payment Proof List, go to *Actions Workspace/Single Touch Processing/STP Payment Proof List*

Select the Reporting Date (usually todayâ€™s date) and relevant filters based on the information you require in the report, e.g. Payroll No., Employee No. and then select your preferred printing or previewing option.

Prior to running a Pay Event we strongly recommend you run the STP Payment Proof List and refer to the last page of the report which lists any errors that may cause the Pay Event to be rejected by the ATO. These errors are similar to those that you may have seen in prior years at EOTY e.g. invalid address, post code, etc.

Save the file in a secure area of your network as the file contains sensitive information about your organisation and employees.
