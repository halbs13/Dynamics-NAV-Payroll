10.2.6	General - Shift Roster
Shift Rosters are used to define work patterns for employees and Shift codes are setup to identify the shifts worked at your organisation.  The employee is automatically paid the hours defined for each shift.  Pay Transactions Types can be allocated to each shift type to automate the payment and are used to add associated transactions (E.g. meal allowance, shift loading) automatically to a shift for a specific pay period to pay the employees.
