### Payroll Selection

A Payroll can be selected by you as the default for all the processes, tasks, and activities.  
If you don’t select a default Payroll when you select a process, task or activity the Payroll Selection window is displayed and you must select the Payroll you wish to perform the activity task or process on before you can continue. 

The Payroll Selection card is used to select or de-select a default Payroll.  It displays a list of Payrolls setup for this company that you have permission to view.

Once you have selected a Payroll to work on, the system locks you in this default Payroll so you can perform processes, tasks and activities without having to filter every time.  This includes the ability to display or change employee records who are assigned to the default payroll.  Only the default Payroll is displayed in the list of Payrolls available for you to process.

You can remove your default Payroll in the Payroll Selection window by selecting the Clear Selection button.  Alternately in the Payroll User Setup – Current Payroll button, delete the value in the Current Payroll No field.

If you choose not to select a default Payroll when you select a Process, Task or Activity the Payroll Selection window is displayed and you must select the Payroll you wish to perform the activity task or process on before you can continue. This selected Payroll only applies to the current activity.
