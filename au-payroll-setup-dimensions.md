10.3	Dimensions
A dimension is a code you add to a general ledger entry for analysis purposes. Dimensions are used throughout the payroll on entries in journals and documents. The term dimension is used in Microsoft Dynamics NAV to describe how analysis occurs. A two-dimensional analysis for example would be sales per area. 

By using more than two dimensions when creating an entry you can carry out a complex analysis, for example sales per sales campaign per customer group per area.

Each dimension can have unlimited dimension values that are sub-units of that dimension. For example a dimension called Department can have departments called Sales, Administration and so on as subunits. These departments are dimension values. 

Dimensions and dimension values are user-defined and unlimited which means you can create dimensions tailored to your company's needs and business processes. 

Dimensions allow the employee costs to be broken down to sub-unit values and consist of the following:

•	Dimensions
•	Dimension Values
•	Dimension Combinations
•	Default Dimension Priorities

This section will only discuss and review the Dimensions, otherwise the setup of this information should be conducted by your Finance Department.

Dimensions are used for financial reporting and are setup by your Finance Department.  Dimensions and dimension values are defined in the General Ledger Granule but they can be viewed and maintained from the Payroll Granule.

For more information about Dimensions you should refer to the General Ledger Granule documentation.
